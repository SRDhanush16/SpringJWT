# Multifactor authentication enabled JSON Web Tokens for Authentication, Authorization using RBAC in Web Applications

This study proposes the integration of 
multifactor authentication (MFA) within a JWT-based 
model to enhance user authenticity verification in 
blockchain applications. By combining these technologies, 
a robust and secure system for verifying user identities is 
established. MFA adds an extra layer of security with 
multiple verification methods. The MFA-enabled JWT 
model, implemented with Spring Boot, Spring Security, 
MySQL, ReactJS, and Java Mail Sender offers protection 
against CSRF, brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and 
man-in-the-middle attacks. Leveraging JWT for 
authentication and authorization minimizes performance 
overhead while ensuring secure user access. Rigorous 
testing using Postman demonstrates the model's reliability 
and effectiveness in safeguarding web applications, 
providing a strong defense against cyber threats and 
enhancing overall system security and user trust. 

## Key Points:
1) Enhanced security with JWT: Implemented JSON Web Tokens for robust security, addressing issues like concurrent logins and protected webpages.
2) Integrated RBAC with JWT: Minimized database querying by embedding Role-Based Access Control within JWT, ensuring efficient and secure access management.
3) Utilized Spring Data JPA: Efficiently managed data querying, enhancing the backend performance and data handling.
4) Implemented OTP security model using JavaMailSender
5) UTilized React-Router-dom to hide all the endpoints and redirect unauthenticated users to login page
